#globalised solution and gridData
#new error- everything highlighted red
#error was on lines 91 and 93, changed c and r around
#added lines 99 and 104- this meant that the grid wasn't reset to its original state after the form was submitted
#new error- when a cell is highlighted red, the number inside is replaced with the correct number (very simple fix on line 104, it was a silly mistake)

#cycle 3- loads of shit getting highligthed wrong when new grids are selected

#things to talk about in evaluation:

#re-submitting the form after deleting an incorrect number resets that cell back to the incorrect number entered
